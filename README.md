## ‚úÖ Validations

The API uses `express-validator` and a custom middleware `handleErrorValidation` to validate request parameters and bodies. If validation errors occur, a `400` response with details will be returned.

**Example validation error**:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "msg": "Brand name is required",
      "param": "name",
      "location": "body"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üåê Headers and Format

- All responses are in **JSON** format.
- For POST/PUT requests, ensure to include:
  ```
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```

## üìå Technical Notes

- Routes are organized by entity in separate files.
- Some category routes should be corrected (see notes above).
- Database connection is handled via Sequelize.
